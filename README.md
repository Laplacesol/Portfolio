## Clinical Dashboard

This hospital resource management dashboard features three tabs providing real-time insights into hospital resources. With the capability to process live patient data, our app enables the filtering and sorting of data to optimize resource utilization and improve patient care. An interactive version is avalable on [shinyapp](https://darthnewhopee.shinyapps.io/emergency/?_ga=2.101306498.2059886193.1680392953-163364251.1680392953).

## Random ADT Generator

The Random ADT Generator creates clinical HL7v.2 transactions, eliminating concerns regarding PHI and de-identification. This script was created using Python.

## Machine Learning

This code uses logistic regression, a statistical model, to predict the presence of diabetes based on a set of features. The features are scaled and the model is trained and evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. The model has a success rate of 74%.

## Mathematica Visualizations

These visualizations showcase 3-projects . The first is a 3D renderd cube that can be moved in any direction. The second is a Pendulum that predicts movement on a mass frictionless surface. The thid is an equi-potential curve for constant electric current. All models were created with Mathematica and LaTex.  Interactive versions are accessible via Mathematica Online Notebook [here](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/tg021/Published/CubeRender.nb), [here](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/tg021/Published/Pendulum.nb), and [here](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/tg021/Published/EquiCurv.nb).
